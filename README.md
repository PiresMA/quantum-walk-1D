# quantum-walk-1D

(In progress)

You can find a better visualization of my .ipynb at 
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/PiresMA/quantum-walk-1D/tree/master/ 


Summary:

qw_01: 

* Probability distribution P_t(x) for the QW and classical walk (CW)
* Scaling behavior of the main spreading measure, namely the standard deviation of P_t(x) 


qw_02: 
* Jensen-Shannon dissimilarity between  P_t(x) arising from the QW and CW. This measure is a bounded symmetrization of the unbounded Kullback-Leibler dissimilarity (KLD).
* For comparison, I also include the Hellinger distance between  P_t(x) from QW and CW


qw_03 (coming soon)
* Distributional measures: Shannon entropy and Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR)


qw_04 (coming soon)
* Von Neumann entanglement entropy
