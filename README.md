# quantum-walk-1D
Summary:

qw_01: 

* Probability distribution P_t(x) for the QW and classical walk (CW)
* Scaling behavior of the main spreading measure, namely the standard deviation of P_t(x) 



qw_02: 
* Jensen-Shannon dissimilarity between  P_t(x) arising from the QW and CW. This measure is a bounded symmetrization of the unbounded Kullback-Leibler dissimilarity (KLD).
* For comparison, I also include the Hellinger distance between  P_t(x) from QW and CW

qw_03 (coming soon)
* Delocalization measures: Entropy and Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR)
