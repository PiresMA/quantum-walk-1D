# quantum-walk-1D
Summary:

qw_01: 

* Probability distribution for the QW and classical walk (CW)
* Scaling behavior of the main spreading measure, namely the standard deviation of P_t(x) 


qw_02: 
* Jensen-Shannon dissimilarity between  P_t(x) arising from the QW and CW
* For comparison I also include the Hellinger distance

qw_03 (coming soon)
* Delocalization measures: Entropy and Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR)
